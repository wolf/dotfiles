## Where is the actual theme (theme.yml)?

I use my dotfiles on multiple OSs.  In some places, like Ubuntu under WSL, I use a dark background.  In most places,
like on the Mac and in Git Bash for Windows, I use a light background.  Light and dark backgrounds need different
foreground colors; therefore, different themes.  Plus, with this mechanism, I don't need to clone the community eza
themes repo.  Yes, I could do something more complicated, but why?  This is the simple solution to the problem.

For light backgrounds I am, at the moment, using the [Rosé Pine Dawn](https://github.com/rose-pine/rose-pine-theme).
On dark backgrounds, [Rosé Pine Moon](https://github.com/rose-pine/rose-pine-theme).
